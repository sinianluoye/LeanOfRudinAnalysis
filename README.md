# motivation
At first, I just wanted to learn some mathematical analysis for fun when I was bored. Someone recommended Rudin's book, and then one day I meet Lean. I wanted to follow along with the book and turn its theorems and so on into Lean code. For a programmer, nothing is more enjoyable than writing code. 

Hope that I can stick with it until I finish.

# about Mathlib
In most cases, I will not use Mathlib, because some of its definitions differ from those described in Rudin's book.

If some tactics are defined through certain mathematical concepts in Mathlib, I will not use them either.
