At first, I just wanted to learn some mathematical analysis for fun when I was bored. Someone recommended Rudin's book, and then one day I meet Lean. I wanted to follow along with the book and turn its theorems and so on into Lean code. For a programmer, nothing is more enjoyable than writing code. 

Hope that I can stick with it until I finish.
